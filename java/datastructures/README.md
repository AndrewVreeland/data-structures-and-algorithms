## Approach & Efficiency
The Big O for my functions would be O(1) for space as you are not  creating new nodes
and for time would be 0(2n) because you have to iterate twice over the separate stacks. however, this simplify down to O(n)
due to the fact that n is infinity and 2 times infinity is negligible.

I created two separate stacks inorder to pop and push the new nodes into their correct locations. inorder to get to the front of the queue
you have to pop everything off and push it into the other queue. a similar process needs to happen for both equations.
